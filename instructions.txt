Oh no!!  
It seems I have accidentally deleted a large chunck of the code
for my pacman game.  Luckily I put most of the logic into
functions but now most of my loops are broken.  Please
fix the loops so we can play PacMan again!!!!

1) loop over game events so we can exit the game
2) add player input so we can move the player
3) check for collisions with the ghosts
4) draw the map
5) draw the ghosts
6) Make a new map
7) extra credit - in the original pacman, some pellets were power up pellets.
    they were bigger and if the player ate them, the ghosts changes colors and 
    pacman could eat the ghosts.  I won't ask you implment the whole power up
    system, but if you found a way to change the color of the ghosts after
    eating a power up pellet, that would be really cool.
